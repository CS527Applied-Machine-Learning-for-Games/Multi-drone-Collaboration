# Sample Factory

The original code base is from: https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory

### Our contributions:
#### Design two policies to make quadrotors can avoid collisions, mean embedding policy and histogram policy.


# gym_art

The original code base is from: https://github.com/amolchanov86/gym_art
Our repo is: https://github.com/Zhehui-Huang/gym_art/tree/cs527

### Our contributions:
#### Extended single-drone simulator, gym_art, to multi-drone simulator
#### Added obstacles to the simulator
#### Implemented 6 interesting scenarios, circular configuration scenario, static goal scenario, dynamic goal scenario, pattern composing scenario, pursuit-evasion scenario, dynamic obstacle scenario 
#### Created a camera for global visualization
#### Create the collision model
#### Visualized the drone collisions


Since our group closely collaborate with the author of the above two projects, most of our contributions/modifications have already been accepted by the author and merged to their code base.

# Goal
##### Create a robust control policy which can allow quadrotors to avoid collisions & obstacles
##### Use Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms to train the policy in a simulated environment.

# Motivation
##### Multi-drone collaboration can be used in many fields, such as search and rescue, surveillance and mapping missions, attack and defense mission

##### Most of previous research are control-based methods can not handle complicated environments and they are computational expensive.
